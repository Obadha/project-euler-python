Problem 1
'''If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

 Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.
 '''

 '''written from scratch'''
 
# def sums ():
# 	prod = 0
# 	for a in range (1, 1000):
# 		if a%3==0 or a%5==0:
# 			prod = prod + a
			
# 	return prod
# 			# b = a+a
# 	# print b
	
# print sums() Answer is 233168


Problem 2
'''
Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

# def fibo(n):
# 	cout = 0 #initialize a var...this will be for the total of even value
# 	a, b = 0, 1
# 	while b < n:
# 		print b

# 		if b % 2 == 0: # check if the number being printed out is divisible by 2.
# 			cout = cout + b #if so, add it the cout.

	
# 		a,b = b, a + b
# 	print cout 
# fibo (4000000) #call the function fib, pass to it the value 4,000,000
